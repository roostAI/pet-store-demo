/*
Scenario 1: Empty name
Test Case 1: Input an empty string as 'name'. Expected Result: An error or exception should be thrown by @NotNull constraint.

Scenario 2: Null name
Test Case 2: Input null as 'name'. Expected Result: An error or exception should be thrown by @NotNull constraint. 

Scenario 3: Valid name
Test Case 3: Input a valid non-null string as 'name'. Expected Result: The Pet object should be created successfully with the provided 'name'.

Scenario 4: Creation of multiple Pets with same name
Test Case 4: Create multiple Pet objects with the same 'name'. Expected Result: Multiple Pet objects should be created successfully with the same name as there is currently no constraint preventing duplicates.

Scenario 5: Creation of multiple Pets with different names
Test Case 5: Create multiple Pet objects with different names. Expected Result: Multiple Pet objects should be created successfully with different names as there is currently no constraint on the uniqueness of the names.

Scenario 6: Creation of a Pet with long name
Test Case 6: Create a Pet with 'name' of length greater than the max allowed String length (for the specific database). Expected Result: An error or exception should be thrown as the length of the 'name' exceeds the max allowed length.

Scenario 7: Creation of a Pet with special characters in name
Test Case 7: Create a Pet with 'name' containing special characters like %, &, !, etc. Expected Result: The Pet object should be created successfully, as there is currently no constraint preventing special characters in name. Return results may vary based on how the database handles these special characters.

Scenario 8: Name with leading and trailing spaces
Test Case 8: Create a Pet with 'name' containing leading or trailing spaces. Expected Result: The Pet object should be created successfully as there is no constraint on the format of the name. However, the actual results may vary based on whether the database trims these spaces during storage or not.
