/*
Based on the code snippet, I can assume that "Pet" is a class and the constructor with field "name" is given. Here are some test scenarios to test this function:

1. Positive Test Scenarios:
   - Test by giving a valid name to the pet constructor during initialization and validate if the pet instance is created successfully with the provided name.
   - Test by giving special characters in the pet name during initialization and validate if the pet instance is created successfully.

2. Negative Test Scenarios:
   - Check what happens if null is passed as input to the "Pet" constructor.
   - Check what happens if an empty string is passed as input to the "Pet" constructor.
   - Check what happens if a very long string is passed as input to the "Pet" constructor.

3. Edge Test Scenarios:
   - Check whether leading and trailing whitespaces in the pet name are handled correctly (Should they be trimmed or preserved).
   - Pass in a string with non-English characters (if your application scenario might involve them) and check how the function behaves.

Please note, you need to modify the test scenarios based on the constraints and requirements provided for the "Pet" class that are not mentioned in the code segment. For example, if there is a character limit on pet "name" that is not mentioned here, you should add a test scenario to check for a name length above that limit as a negative test scenario.
