/*
Since your code snippet only shows an empty constructor for the Pet class and there are no other methods or properties given, I'll assume some basic functions of a hypothetical Pet class that has an id and name. Here are the test scenarios for the given Pet class:

1. Test if a new instance of the Pet class is created without any arguments (which is valid as the constructor provided is an empty one).
2. Test if a newly created instance of a Pet class has a state and behavior as defined by its fields and methods.
3. Test if the id field is correctly auto-generated. To do this, create two instances and ensure their id fields are different. 
4. Validate that the id field is not manually editable, i.e., the system should throw an error if the user tries to set the id.
5. Validate if the id field is generated when the new pet is persisted into the database. a pet without id should not be inserted into the database.
6. Test if the name field correctly retains its value when a value is set.
7. Validate that the name field has @NotNull constraints, i.e., the system should throw an error if the user tries to set the name to null.
8. Validate if the constructor is protected as described, i.e., the instance cannot be created from a different package.
9. Test if the instance creation fails when done from a subclass not in the same package (binding test).
